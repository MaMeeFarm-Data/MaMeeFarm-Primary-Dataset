# DGCP Data Collection Start Declaration (2026)

## Purpose

This document declares the official starting point for continuous, long-term
data collection under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework
for the MaMeeFarm™ Primary Dataset.

The purpose of this declaration is to clearly distinguish between
early experimental records and production-grade continuous data collection.

---

## Declaration

- **Year 2025** is designated as a **structure design and experimental phase**.
  During this period, the DGCP framework, folder structures, file formats,
  verification workflows, and governance principles were developed and tested.

- **Year 2026 onward** is designated as the official start of
  **continuous, long-term DGCP data collection**.

From 2026, data units are created with the expectation of:
- Consistency
- Long-term preservation
- Research-grade integrity
- Append-only, non-destructive governance

---

## Interpretation of 2025 Data

All data recorded during 2025 remains valid and verifiable.

However, 2025 data should be interpreted as:
- Early proof-of-concept
- Structural and governance experimentation
- Historical context for the dataset
- Foundation for continuous operations beginning in 2026

No retroactive continuity requirements are imposed on 2025 data.

---

## Governance Principle

This declaration exists to:
- Prevent retrospective reinterpretation
- Avoid ambiguity regarding data continuity expectations
- Establish a clear, documented intent prior to long-term collection
- Protect both the data owner and future data users from misinterpretation

This file is **not a data unit** and **does not represent observational data**.
It is a governance-level declaration.

---

## Status

This declaration is final and intentionally immutable.
Any future policy changes must be documented as a new governance file.
