## Ledger Scope

This ledger records the continuity of DGCP Data Units
generated from real-world activities on 2026-02-04.

The ledger serves as a continuity and integrity checkpoint only.
It does not summarize activities, interpret events, or assert outcomes.

---

## Data Unit Coverage

DataUnit Range: **00927 – 00968**  
Total Data Units: **42**

All Data Units listed:
- originate from direct human activity,
- were recorded sequentially,
- and remain unchanged after initial commit.

---

## Verification Model

- A SHA-256 hash exists for each individual Data Unit file.
- OpenTimestamps (OTS) verification is performed **per Data Unit**.
- OTS creation is executed manually by the operator.
- This ledger does **not** claim batch or aggregate OTS completion.

Verification must be assessed at the file level.

---

## Integrity Conditions

- No Data Unit was reconstructed.
- No ordering was altered.
- No content was inferred, summarized, or reinterpreted.
- All references remain as originally recorded.

The ledger does not replace file-level verification artifacts.

---

## Responsibility Statement

Responsibility for Data Unit creation, sequencing,
and OpenTimestamps verification
rests with a single operator.

This ledger asserts continuity only.

---

## Date Alignment

The difference between the activity date (2026-02-04)
and the ledger commit date (2026-02-05)
is acknowledged as an operational constraint.

This does not affect data integrity or verifiability.
