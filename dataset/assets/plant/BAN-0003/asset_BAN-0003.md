# Asset Record — BAN-0003

Asset ID: BAN-0003  
Asset Type: Plant  
Common Name: Banana Tree  
Plant Category: Perennial Plant  

Zone: FZ-03  

Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)

## Asset Identity

This record represents a persistent physical banana tree registered as a verifiable
plant asset within the MaMeeFarm™ Ground Truth system.

The asset exists independently of any single event and serves as a stable reference
point for all related proofs, data units, and lifecycle activities.

---

## Primary Lifecycle Event

Primary Event: Inflorescence Cut  
Event Date: 2026-01-28  

Reference:
- Proof: 557  
- DataUnit: 00724  

This event marks a major biological transition in the plant’s lifecycle
and establishes the starting point for subsequent tracking.

## Derived Biological Asset

### Derived Asset: Banana Blossom

- Derived From Asset: BAN-0003  
- Asset Type: Banana Blossom  
- Event: Blossom Separation  

Reference:
- Proof: 557  
- DataUnit: 00731  

This derived biological asset originates directly from BAN-0003
as part of its natural reproductive process.

The derived asset is biologically linked to the parent plant
but may follow its own independent handling or lifecycle records.

## Recorded Care Events

None recorded as of this entry.

## Timeline Evidence

Photographic evidence confirms asset existence, primary lifecycle event,
and derived biological asset separation as of:
- Recorded Timestamp: 2026-01-29 13:26 (Local)

---

## System Significance

This asset demonstrates:

- Initialization of a new persistent plant asset
- Clear handling of **derived biological assets** without fragmenting identity
- Separation of asset identity, lifecycle events, and derived outputs
- Verifiable linkage between physical reality and digital records

The asset functions as a long-lived reference anchor
within the DGCP™ framework.
