# Asset Record — BAN-0001

Asset ID: BAN-0001  
Asset Type: Plant  
Common Name: Banana Tree  

Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
License: DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025  

---

## Asset Identity

This record represents a persistent physical banana tree registered as a verifiable plant asset within the MaMeeFarm™ Ground Truth system.

The asset exists independently of any single event and serves as a stable reference point for all related proofs, data units, and lifecycle activities.

---

## Primary Lifecycle Event

Primary Event: Inflorescence Cut  
Event Date: 2026-01-16  

Reference:
- Proof: 498  
- DataUnit: 00332  

This event marks a significant biological transition in the plant’s lifecycle and establishes the initial state for subsequent care tracking.

---

## Recorded Care Events

### Care Event 01
- Reference Proof: 517  
- Reference DataUnit: 00528  

### Care Event 02
- Reference Proof: 527  
- Reference DataUnit: 00528  

Care events are recorded as independent verifiable actions while maintaining continuity with the same physical asset.

---

## Timeline Evidence

Photographic evidence confirms continued asset existence and care activity as of:
- Recorded Timestamp: 2026-01-25 17:42 (Local)

---

## System Significance

This asset demonstrates:

- Stable physical identity over time  
- Separation of asset, event, proof, and data unit layers  
- Continuous real-world lifecycle documentation  
- Verifiable linkage between physical reality and digital records  

The asset functions as a long-lived reference anchor within the DGCP™ framework.

# Asset Snapshot — BAN-0001 (Post Care Event 03)

Snapshot Date (Local): 2026-01-30  
Snapshot Time (Local): 07:40  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  

Asset ID: BAN-0001  
Asset Type: Plant  
Common Name: Banana Tree  
Zone: FZ-03  

Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)

## Snapshot Purpose

This file represents a **state snapshot** of the physical banana tree asset BAN-0001
after the completion of Care Event 03.

It provides a consolidated, human-readable view of the asset’s verified lifecycle
and care history **as observed at the snapshot timestamp**.

This snapshot does **not** replace or rewrite the authoritative asset record.
All historical events remain preserved in the primary asset file.

---

## Asset Identity (Stable)

BAN-0001 is a persistent physical banana tree registered as a verifiable plant asset
within the MaMeeFarm™ Ground Truth system.

The asset identity remains unchanged across all recorded events.

---

## Lifecycle & Care Events (Re-stated Snapshot)

### Primary Lifecycle Event
- Event: Inflorescence Cut  
- Event Date: 2026-01-16  
- Reference Proof: 498  
- Reference DataUnit: 00332  

### Care Event 01 (Re-stated)
- Reference Proof: 517  
- Reference DataUnit: 00528  

### Care Event 02 (Re-stated)
- Reference Proof: 527  
- Reference DataUnit: 00528  

### Care Event 03
- Event Type: Selective Sucker Removal  
- Reference Proof: 563  
- Zone: FZ-03  

---

## Observed Asset State (as of Snapshot)

- Asset remains physically present and identifiable
- Care actions have progressed in chronological order
- No conflicting or duplicate events detected
- Asset continuity remains intact across all proofs

Photographic evidence confirms asset existence and care activity
at the snapshot timestamp.

---

## System Significance

This snapshot demonstrates:

- Clear separation between **authoritative asset records** and **state views**
- Append-only historical integrity
- Reliable reconstruction of asset state at a specific point in time
- Compatibility with audit, AI ingestion, and human verification workflows

The snapshot functions as a **read-only state view**
derived from verifiable DGCP evidence.
