## Registration Note (Temporal Order Disclosure)

This water tank was deployed and actively used
prior to formal asset ID registration.

Supporting photographic evidence, dataunits,
and proof records exist earlier in the system
than the asset registration date.

This delayed registration reflects real-world
operational sequencing and does not constitute
retroactive data modification.

All referenced data remains verifiable.
