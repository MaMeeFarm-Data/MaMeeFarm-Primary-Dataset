## Asset Identity

This record represents a persistent open-area zone within the MaMeeFarm™ system,
designated as HZ-01.

HZ-01 is a physically open yard space
enclosed by perimeter fencing
and controlled through defined access gates.

The zone functions as a transition and activity area
connecting internal farm zones
with surrounding agricultural land.

HZ-01 exists as a stable spatial asset
independent of daily use, movement, or temporary activity.

---

## Physical Characteristics

- Open ground area with natural surface  
- Perimeter fencing enclosing the zone  
- Defined entry/exit gates  
- Clear visual boundary between internal farm space and external land  

These characteristics define HZ-01 as a controlled open zone
rather than a residential or production area.

---

## Asset Scope

The functional scope of HZ-01 includes:

- General open-yard activities  
- Controlled access point via gates  
- Transitional movement between zones  
- Spatial buffer between farm interior and exterior areas  

This scope reflects physical reality
without embedding operational schedules or events.

## Recorded Events

None recorded in this asset file.

Events related to gate installation, fence modification,
or structural changes will be recorded only
if and when permanent changes occur.

## System Significance

This zone asset demonstrates:

- Identity correction based on real-world observation  
- Clear distinction between open zones and built/residential zones  
- Alignment of digital records with physical ground truth  
- Low-maintenance asset documentation suitable for long-term use  

HZ-01 functions as a long-lived spatial reference anchor
within the DGCP™ framework.
