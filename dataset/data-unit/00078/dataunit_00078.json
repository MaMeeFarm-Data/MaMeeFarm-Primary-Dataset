  "description": "This record documents the refilling of a water storage tank in the vegetable plot zone. The operation was performed during midday when solar power from panels was available to drive the water pump. Outside the 10:00–15:00 window, electrical power is required for both pumping and farm data system operations, so water was prepared and stored in advance.",
