# DGCP Governance Error Log — V2
Date: 2026-01-11  
Project: MaMeeFarm™ Primary Dataset  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)

## Purpose of This Update
This V2 entry clarifies the verification metadata status
related to DGCP Data Unit 00173, following the initial
error log recorded earlier on the same date.

## Clarification Summary
An OpenTimestamps (OTS) receipt file for data unit 00173
exists and was successfully generated.

However, the SHA-256 hash value of the original JSON file
was not recorded in commit metadata at the time of upload.

Due to tooling limitations on the operating environment,
the SHA-256 value was not subsequently recalculated.

## Evidence Status
- OTS receipt file: Exists
- Original data unit content: Unchanged
- SHA-256 value: Not recorded
- Evidence regeneration: Not performed

## Rationale
No regeneration of cryptographic evidence was performed,
as the original OTS receipt remains valid and intact.

The condition is documented transparently to preserve
historical accuracy and prevent redundant or duplicative
timestamping.

## Impact Assessment
- Data integrity: Not compromised
- Evidence existence: Confirmed
- Metadata completeness: Partial
- Audit transparency: Preserved

## Resolution
This limitation is accepted and recorded.
No further corrective action is required.
