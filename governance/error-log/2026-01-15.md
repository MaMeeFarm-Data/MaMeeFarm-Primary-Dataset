# DGCP Governance Error Log
Date: 2026-01-15  
Project: MaMeeFarm™ Primary Dataset  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)

## Context
This log documents an operational interruption related to
DGCP Data Unit 00274, whose primary activity occurred on
2026-01-14.

## Situation Summary
The data unit JSON file was created on 2026-01-14 under
limited power conditions. Due to insufficient power supply,
the system shut down before the SHA-256 hash value could be
recorded in commit metadata.

An OpenTimestamps (OTS) receipt file for the data unit
exists and was successfully generated.

## Classification
Operational interruption due to power constraints  
(non-malicious, non-procedural error)

## Evidence Status
- Data unit activity date: 2026-01-14
- Commit and upload date: 2026-01-15
- OTS receipt file: Exists
- SHA-256 value: Not recorded
- Evidence regeneration: Not performed

## Rationale
No regeneration of cryptographic evidence was performed.
The original OTS receipt remains intact, and recreating
timestamps would introduce unnecessary duplication.

The missing SHA-256 recording is transparently documented
as a consequence of environmental constraints.

## Impact Assessment
- Data integrity: Not compromised
- Evidence existence: Confirmed
- Metadata completeness: Partial
- Timeline transparency: Preserved across dates

## Resolution
This condition is accepted and logged.
No further corrective action is required.
