# DGCP Governance — Error Log

Date (Local): 2026-02-07  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  
Log Type: Human Operational Oversight / Asset Identifier Mismatch

## Summary
This log documents a human operational metadata error
involving an incorrect asset identifier recorded in
Data Unit 01015 at commit time.

The underlying image evidence, capture context,
and cryptographic verification remain intact and valid.

## Affected Record
- Data Unit ID: 01015
- Recorded asset_id (incorrect): SUM-PMP-0003
- Correct asset_id: HZ-PMP-0003
- Asset type: submersible_pump
- Event (capture) date: 2026-02-06
- Commit date: 2026-02-07
- Status: Committed, SHA-256 and OTS completed

## What Happened (Fact-Only)
1. The operational event was captured on 2026-02-06.
2. Due to real-world operational constraints, the
   Data Unit was committed on 2026-02-07.
3. During Data Unit preparation, the asset identifier
   was mistakenly recorded as SUM-PMP-0003.
4. Post-commit review confirmed that the correct
   asset identifier corresponding to the recorded
   pump is HZ-PMP-0003.
5. The image evidence and operational context
   unambiguously correspond to asset HZ-PMP-0003.

## Root Cause
Human operational oversight during metadata entry,
occurring under constrained electrical system
availability at the time of processing.

## Impact
- Data integrity: Not compromised.
- Cryptographic integrity (SHA-256, OTS): Valid.
- Scope of issue: Asset identifier metadata only.
- Evidence authenticity: Preserved and verifiable.

## Resolution
No modification was made to Data Unit 01015 to
preserve post-OTS immutability.

This governance log serves as the canonical correction
and clarification for the asset identifier associated
with this Data Unit.

## Notes
- The commit date differs from the capture date due
  to limited electrical system availability.
- This was not a data capture failure or asset misuse.
- No evidence was rewritten, regenerated, or inferred
  after OTS completion.
