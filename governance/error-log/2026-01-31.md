# DGCP Governance — Error Log

Date (Local): 2026-01-31  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  
Log Type: Human Operational Oversight / Commit Metadata Omission

## Summary
This log records a human operational oversight where
Data Unit 00786 was correctly generated, hashed, and
timestamped (OTS), but the corresponding commit message
metadata was incomplete at the time of upload.

## Affected Record
- Data Unit ID: 00786  
- Event (capture) date: 2026-01-30  
- Commit date: 2026-01-31  
- Status: File content correct, SHA-256 valid, OTS completed

## What Happened (Fact-Only)
1. The data capture event occurred on 2026-01-30.
2. Data Unit 00786 was committed on 2026-01-31.
3. The Data Unit file, SHA-256 hash, and OTS receipt
   were generated correctly.
4. During commit, the commit message metadata field
   was unintentionally left incomplete.

## Root Cause
Human operational oversight during manual commit
under real-world working conditions.

## Impact
- Data integrity: Not compromised.
- Cryptographic verification: Fully valid.
- Traceability: Preserved through file structure,
  SHA-256 hash, and OTS receipt.
- Issue scope: Commit message metadata only.

## Resolution
No modification was made to Data Unit 00786, its hash,
or its OTS receipt.

This governance log serves as the canonical explanation
for the commit metadata omission.

## Notes
- This is not a data content error.
- No evidence was rewritten or regenerated.
- Event date and commit date differ due to
  operational timing.
