# DGCP Governance Error Log
Date: 2026-01-11  
Project: MaMeeFarm™ Primary Dataset  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)

## Error Summary
Missing OpenTimestamps (OTS) receipt reference
for DGCP Data Unit 00173 during initial commit.

## Error Type
Human operational oversight (non-malicious)

## Description
During routine dataset updates, the OTS receipt
for data unit 00173 was generated but not referenced
in the corresponding commit at the time of upload.

The data unit content, SHA-256 hash, and file structure
remained unchanged. Only the verification layer
(OTS reference) was incomplete.

## Detection
The omission was identified during a manual
repository review while verifying dataset
integrity and commit history.

## Resolution
A corrective commit was issued to add the missing
OTS receipt for data unit 00173, restoring full
cryptographic verifiability in accordance with
DGCP standards.

No data content was altered.

## Impact Assessment
- Data integrity: Not compromised
- Verifiability: Temporarily incomplete, now restored
- Timeline consistency: Preserved

## Preventive Notes
This log documents a normal human error case
to preserve transparency and improve future
operational discipline without penalizing
real-world workflows.

## Classification
Operational Error — Logged and Resolved
