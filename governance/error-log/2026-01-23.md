# DGCP Governance — Error Log

Date (Local): 2026-01-23  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  
Log Type: Data Integrity / Missing Field (No Rewrite)

## Scope
This log documents a data integrity condition related to
a temperature/humidity capture event that occurred on
2026-01-22, with commit and OpenTimestamps (OTS)
processing completed on 2026-01-23.

## Summary
A temperature/humidity-related Data Unit was committed
and timestamped (OTS) as an image-only record.
The numeric temperature and humidity values were not
included in the Data Unit file at commit time.

This log records the condition transparently without
rewriting or modifying the original Data Unit after OTS.

## Affected Record
- Data Unit ID: 00530  
- Event (capture) date: 2026-01-22  
- Commit + OTS date: 2026-01-23  
- Record type: Image-only (photo evidence)  
- Status: Committed and OTS completed

## What Happened (Fact-Only)
1. The temperature/humidity event occurred on 2026-01-22
   and was captured as photo evidence.
2. On 2026-01-23, Data Unit 00530 was committed and
   timestamped (OTS) as an image-only record.
3. After commit and OTS completion, it was identified
   that numeric temperature and humidity values were not
   transcribed into the Data Unit JSON file.
4. The image evidence displays the temperature and
   humidity values, but those values were not recorded
   as machine-readable fields in the Data Unit.

## Root Cause
Order-of-operations under operational constraints:
the Data Unit content was finalized (commit + OTS)
before numeric temperature and humidity fields were
transcribed into the Data Unit file.

No rewrite was performed after OTS.

## Impact
- Data Unit 00530 remains verifiable as photo evidence.
- Numeric temperature/humidity values are not
  machine-readable within the Data Unit file.
- Verification remains possible through the original
  image evidence.
- No data falsification or inference occurred.

## Resolution
No modification was made to Data Unit 00530 in order
to preserve post-OTS immutability.

This governance log serves as the canonical correction
and explanation for auditors and downstream users.

## Corrective Action (Forward-Looking)
For future temperature/humidity records:
- Include numeric temperature and humidity fields in
  the Data Unit JSON at creation time, OR
- Explicitly classify the record as "image-only" at
  creation, and if numeric transcription is required
  later, record it in a new Data Unit or a governance
  note (no rewrite).

## Notes
- This was not a sensor failure or capture failure.
- No numeric inference or transcription was performed
  after OTS completion.
- Event date and commit/OTS date differ due to
  real-world operational constraints.
