## Scope of Record

This daily log documents **real-world activities that occurred on 2026-02-07**.

Some data units were committed on the same day (2026-02-07),
while others were committed on the following day (2026-02-08)
**without any modification, correction, or reinterpretation**.

This separation reflects operational constraints only.
All records remain immutable after capture.

## Data Unit Coverage

DataUnit Range: **01037 – 01063**

All data units in this range:
- were captured from real-world activities on 2026-02-07
- were recorded under limited labor, power, and system availability
- were committed either on 2026-02-07 or 2026-02-08
- were not edited post-capture

## Commit Timing Clarification

- Commit timing does **not** redefine activity date
- Activity date is determined solely by capture context
- Commit date reflects system availability only

This log preserves the distinction between:
- **Recorded activity date**
- **Repository commit date**

As required by DGCP™ standards.
